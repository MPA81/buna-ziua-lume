VI Commands [My personal reference on how to use the worlds most prolific text editor]
[We will attempt to organize this at some point, but don't go holding your breath yet]

First we need to establish that VI/vim has two separate modes of operation:
they are    1)Insert mode   -   where we type whatever needs to be seen
            2)Command mode  -   this is where vim does its editing

The single most asked question on StackOverflow, for the longest time was:
"How do I exit Vim?". And I admit, the first time that you experience interacting with
what may eventually become your best friend, the first thought you will more than probably
have is not "How do I make this program work for me?", but "What fresh hell is this?" and
"How in the world do I get out of here?"...
Without further ado:
    1)ZZ    -   Save and exit
    2):q!   -   Quit and exit (no save) 
                [the ! [exclamation mark] is there to force the exit; vim normally informs
                you if you have unsaved work and will not permit you to run away from it.] 

Something odd that you may notice in the second option above is the use of the : [colon].
While in command mode some items may require this precursor.  All the commands that I list
here, that require a colon, will be listed with it present.

Entering insert mode:
    1)i     -   start inserting text before the current cursor location
    2)a     -   start inserting text behind the current cursor location
    3)I     -   start inserting text at the begining of the current line
    4)A     -   start inserting text at the end of the current line
    5)o     -   start a new line below the curent one
    6)O     -   start a new line above the current one

Exiting insert mode is done by the simple use of the:
    -)Esc [Escape]  -   Exit insert mode

Once you get used with having to exit insert mode, you will find yourself reaching for
that escape key in programs that do not require it... well it becomes a problem.

Moving around while in command mode:
    1)h     -   move left
    2)j     -   move down
    3)k     -   move up
    4)l     -   move right
    5)0     -   move to the beggining of the line 
    6)$     -   move to the end of the line

[... more basic info ...]

To see all options configured, while in command mode:
    :set

To see which file takes precendence (set the option last), while in command mode:
    :5verbose set <option>?
    [If we are having a hard time overriding a particular option, in ~/.vim directory
    there is an after/ directory
