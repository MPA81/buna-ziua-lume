AWK commands

##### From "The GNU Awk User's Guide" | gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html #####

Command line apparence and results

$ echo hi on stdout
-| hi on stdout
$ echo hello on stderr 1>&2
error-> hello on stderr

(the $ symbol indicates that we find ourselves on the command line.
 -|         indicates std output
 error ->   indicates std error)


Awk file format

pattern {action}
pattern {action}


Run awk Programs

-command line:
$ awk 'program' input-file1 input-file2

(The single quotes around the program are there so that the shell won't interprete any awk
commands awk characters as special shell characters.  Quotes also cause the shell to
treat all of the program as a single argument for the awk command, and permit the program
to be more than one line long)

-from files
$ awk -f program-file.awk input-file1 input-file2

(the .awk file extension is not technically necessary)

-without input files
$ awk 'program'

(applies the program to the standard input. continues until you indicate EOF via Ctrl-d)

*small example
$ awk 'BEGIN { print "Don\47t Panic!" }'
-| Don't Panic!

(statements associated with BEGIN are executed before awk reads any input.  If there are
no other statements in a program, awk just stops. \47 is a 'magic way' of getting a
single quote without engaging shell quoting tricks.)

*small example 
$ awk '{ print }'
hello my baby, hello my honey
-| hello my baby, hello my honey
hello my spring time gal
-| hello my spring time gal
if you refuse me
-| if you refuse me 
Ctrl-d

(whatever is typed in to std in will be sent to std out. Ctrl-d necessary to exit)

-executable awk programs

$ touch advice
$ vi advice 
___
#! /bin/awk -f

BEGIN { print "Don't Panic!" }
___

$ chmod +x advice
$ ./advice
-| Don't Panic

(awk is an interpreted language.  /bin/awk is the interpreter.
 the shebang '#!' indicates an interpreter directive to the program loader, in other
 words that set of symbols says that what follows is an interpreter for the rest of the
 program that follows.  NOTE: some systems limit the length of the interpreter name to 32
 characters. If necessary use a symbolic link)

-comments in awk programs

$ vi moreadvice
___
# This here is a comment 
# This is also a comment
BEGIN { print "Don't Panic!" } # This here, you guessed it, also a comment.
___
$ awk -f moreadvice 
-| Don't Panic!

( # indicates a comment, it does not need to be at the beggining of the line.
CAUTION: when enclosing a short program in single quotes do not put an apostrophe into a
comment or anywhere else in your program.  Shell interprets this other quote as the
closing quote for the entire program. A backslash before the single quote will not help
in this situation. backslashes are not special inside single quotes.)

-null string

$ echo ""
-| 

Although no characters present in printed string, it does exist. Simply an empty string.

-search for string

awk '/<string>/ { print $0 }' <file to be seached>

$ awk '/li/ { print $0 }' mail-list
-| Amelia      555-5553    amelia.zodiacusque@gmail.com    F
-| Broderick   555-0542    broderick.aliquotens@yahoo.com  R
-| Julie       555-6699    julie.persrutabor@skeeve.com    F
-| Samuel      555-3430    samuel.lanceolis@shu.edu        A

-print every line longer than n characters

awk 'length($0) > <n>' <file_name>

$ awk 'length($0) > 40' charcnt.txt
-| there are 50 characters on this line, dig .......
-| this here is the longest line in this file, ok, nothing more to it

-print the length of the longest line

$ awk '{ if (length($0) > max) max = length($0) }
> END { print max }' charcnt.txt
-| 66

code associated with END executes after all input has been read.

or

$ expand charcnt.txt | awk '{ if (x < length($0)) x = length($0)}
> END { print "maximum line length is " x }'
-| maximum line length is 66

input is processed by the expand utility to change TABs into spaces; thus the widths
compared are actually the right-margin columns, as opposed to the number of input 
characters on each line.

-print every line that has at least one field

$ awk 'NF > 0' charcnt.txt
-|10 chars.
-|20 characters here.
-|30 characters on this line ..
-|40 characters be on this line here you.
-|there are 50 characters on this line, dig .......
-|this here is the longest line in this file, ok, nothing more to it

easy way to delete blank lines from a file (create new file w/o blank lines)

-print seven random numbers from 0 to 100, inclusive:

$ awk 'BEGIN { for (i = 1;  i <=7; i++)
> print int(101 * rand()) }'
-|84
-|39
-|79
-|80
-|92
-|19
-|33

-print the total number of bytes used by the files

$ ls -l mail-list charcnt.txt | awk '{ x += $5 }
> END { print "total bytes: " x }'
-|total bytes: 861

-print the total number of kilobytes used by the files

$ ls -l mail-list charcnt.txt | awk '{ x += $5 }
> END { print "total K-bytes", x / 1024 }'
-|total K-bytes: 0.84082

-print a sorted list of the login names of all users

awk -F: '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd | sort

(reasons why this is presented in this format should be obvious to the reader)

-count the lines in a file

$ awk 'END { print NR }' charcnt.txt
-|12

-print the even-numbered lines in the charcnt.txt file

$ awk 'NR % 2 == 0' charcnt.txt
-|
-|10 chars.
-|
-|30 characters on this line ..
-|40 characters be on this line here you.
-|this here is the longest line in this file, ok, nothing more to it

using 'NR % 2 == 1' would print the odd-numbered lines 


*example with two rules

___
/12/  { print $0 } 
/21/  { print $0 }
___

rule one has string '12' as a pattern and 'print $0' as an action
rule two has string '21' as a pattern and 'print $0' as an action
program prints every line that contains the string '12' or the string '21'.
a line that contains both strings is printed twice, once by each rule

$ awk '/12/  { print $0 }
> /21/  { print $0 }' mail-list inventory-shipped
-|Anthony     555-3412    anthony.asserturo@hotmail.com   A
-|Camilla     555-2912    camilla.infusarum@skynet.be     R
-|Fabius      555-1234    fabius.undevicesimus@ucb.edu    F
-|Jean-Paul   555-2127    jeanpaul.campanorum@nyu.edu     R
-|Jean-Paul   555-2127    jeanpaul.campanorum@nyu.edu     R
-|Jan 21  36  64  401
-|Apr 21  70  74  514

('Jean-Paul' line printed twice, one for each rule.

*a more complex example

S ls -l | awk '$6 == "Nov" { sum += $5 }
> END { print sum }'

program will print the total number of bytes in all files modified in November (of any
year) present in current directory 

ls -l       ~ listing of the files with size and date the file was modified
             Sixth field of listing is the month
             Fifth field of listing is file size in bytes

$6 == "Nov" ~ test whether sixth field of the ls -l output matches the string "Nov"

sum += $5   ~ each time the expression above is true awk adds the value of the fifth 
             field to the variable 'sum'
             (Note: all awk variables are automatically initialized to 0)

END { print sum }
            ~ after the last line output from ls is processsed, END rule executess and
             prints value of sum


*awk Statements Versus Lines



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Different source.  May keep or delete, undecided. ###

BEGIN {awk-commands} -- optional
/pattern/ {awk-commands} 
END {awk-commmands} -- optional

### Command Line ###

awk [options] file ...

awk '{print}' filename.txt
--above command will print the contents of <filename.txt> line by line

awk 'BEGIN{printf "Wha Who\tQue\tWhi} {print}' filename.txt
--above command will first print a header of:
    Wha{space}Who{tab}Que{tab}Whi
  followed by the contents of <filename.txt> line by line.

### Program file ###

--first create a file with the extention <.awk>
touch marks.awk

--then add the following instructions to the file 
{print}

--finally on the command line enter the command:
awk -f marks.awk <filename.txt> 

--command will print the contents of <filename.txt> line by line


### Standard Options ###

-v  assigns a value to a variable

  **Example**
awk -v name=Jerry 'BEGIN{printf "Name = %s\n, name}'
    Result
Name = Jerry
